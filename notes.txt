Okay, trying to determine which processes to start with first, doing a tally

Semantic/Keyword match      5
External API                4
Ask Submitter/Google Form   8 (wow)
Shorten                     1

So techically I should start w an intelligent google form but ...
for some reason I thought Google forms weren't going to be relied upon as much.
3 fields that Google Forms also cite 3 Semantic match

So it look like, actualy, a good semantic matcher is needed? I should probably 
catpure the Google Places API call function to date and switch here.

okay so thinking this through, I should probably have utils folder that includes
methods. The init can also import already created methods if they're duplicated or 
parameterized. 

Following my assessment, those methods are then used in processes, which can be done depending
on the need, so like, finte state machine (https://github.com/pytransitions/transitions#quickstart),
py rq

For description standardization I want to identify all acronymns and "unstandardized" language

see: https://github.com/doccano/doccano

trying to find other interactive NLP engines, though
see: https://github.com/NIHOPA/NLPre
a specific proprocessing library, w00t!

? https://github.com/philgooch/abbreviation-extraction

also, I should lead with the most accurate standardization, which is probably Google places addresses normalization
